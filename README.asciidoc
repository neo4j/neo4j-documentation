= About Neo4j documentation

This repository contains tools and tests for proving and generating documentation for https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/[Neo4j].

All docs sources are maintained in AsciiDoc format.
The primary output of building the projects kept here are artifacts (JARs) containing docs sources, code examples, and some scripts and images.
These are processed downstream with custom tools, Asciidoctor and XSLT to produce the library of documentation available at https://neo4j.com/docs/.
