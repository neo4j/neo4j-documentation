= The use of indexes

[abstract]
--
This section describes the query plans when indexes are used in various scenarios.
--

The task of tuning calls for different indexes depending on what the queries look like.
Therefore, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of how the indexes operate.
This section describes the query plans that result from different index scenarios.

Node indexes and relationship indexes operate in the same way.
Therefore, node and relationship indexes are used interchangeably in this section.

Please refer to <<administration-indexes-search-performance>> for instructions on how to create and maintain the indexes themselves.

== Index types and predicate compatibility

There are different types of indexes available in Neo4j but they are not all compatible with the same property predicates.

Indexes are commonly used for `MATCH` and `OPTIONAL MATCH` clauses that combine a label predicate with a property predicate.
Therefore, it is important to know what kind of predicates that can be solved by the different indexes.

=== BTREE indexes

`BTREE` indexes support all types of predicates:

[options="header"]
|===
|Predicate | Syntax
|equality check| `n.prop = value`
|list membership check| `n.prop IN list`
|existence check| `n.prop IS NOT NULL`
|range search| `n.prop > value`
|prefix search| `STARTS WITH`
|suffix search| `ENDS WITH`
|substring search| `CONTAINS`
|===

=== TEXT indexes

`TEXT` indexes only work for predicates operating on strings.
That means that `TEXT` indexes are only used when it is known that the predicate evaluates to `null` for all non-string values.

Predicates that only operate on strings are always solvable by a `TEXT` index:

* `STARTS WITH`
* `ENDS WITH`
* `CONTAINS`

However, other predicates are only used when it is known that the property is compared to a string:

* `n.prop = "string"`
* `n.prop IN ["a", "b", "c"]`
* `n.prop > "string"`

This means that a `TEXT` index is not able to solve e.g. `a.prop = b.prop`.

In summary, `TEXT` indexes support the following predicates:

[options="header"]
|===
|Predicate | Syntax
|equality check| `n.prop = "string"`
|list membership check | `n.prop IN ["a", "b", "c"]`
|range search| `n.prop > "string"`
|prefix search| `STARTS WITH`
|suffix search| `ENDS WITH`
|substring search| `CONTAINS`
|===

== Index preference

When multiple indexes are available and able to solve a predicate, there is an order defined that decides which index to use.
It is defined as such:

* `TEXT` indexes are preferred over `BTREE` indexes for `CONTAINS` and `ENDS WITH`.
* `BTREE` indexes are preferred over `TEXT` indexes in all other cases.
