[[query-operators-property]]
== Property operators

[NOTE]
Since version 2.0, the previously supported property operators `?` and `!` have been removed.
This syntax is no longer supported.
Missing properties are now returned as `null`.
Please use `(NOT(has(<ident>.prop)) OR <ident>.prop=<value>)` if you really need the old behavior of the `?` operator.
-- Also, the use of `?` for optional relationships has been removed in favor of the newly-introduced `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause.
