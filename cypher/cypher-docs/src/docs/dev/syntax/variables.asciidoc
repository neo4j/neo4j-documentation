Overview of variables in Cypher.
--

When you reference parts of a pattern or a query, you do so by naming them.
The names you give the different parts are called variables.

In this example:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)-->(b)
RETURN b
----

The variables are `n` and `b`.

Information regarding the naming of variables may be found <<cypher-naming, here>>.

[IMPORTANT]
.Variables are only visible in the same query part
====
Variables are not carried over to subsequent queries.
If multiple query parts are chained together using `WITH`, variables have to be listed in the `WITH` clause to be carried over to the next part.
For more information see <<query-with>>.
