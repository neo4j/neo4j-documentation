[[cypher-parameters-introduction]]
== Introduction

Cypher supports querying with parameters.
This means developers don't have to resort to string building to create a query.
Additionally, parameters make caching of execution plans much easier for Cypher, thus leading to faster query execution times.

Parameters can be used for:

* literals and expressions
* node and relationship ids

Parameters cannot be used for the following constructs, as these form part of the query structure that is compiled into a query plan:

* property keys; so, `MATCH (n) WHERE n.$param = 'something'` is invalid
* relationship types
* labels

Parameters may consist of letters and numbers, and any combination of these, but cannot start with a number or a currency symbol.

For details on using parameters via the Neo4j HTTP API, see the <<http-api#http-api, HTTP API documentation>>.

We provide below a comprehensive list of examples of parameter usage.
In these examples, parameters are given in JSON; the exact manner in which they are to be submitted depends upon the driver being used.

[NOTE]
====
The old parameter syntax `+{param}+` was deprecated in Neo4j 3.0 and removed entirely in Neo4j 4.0.
Using it will result in a syntax error.
However, it is still possible to use it, with warnings, if you prefix the query with `CYPHER 3.5`.
See <<cypher-compatibility, Cypher Compatibility>> for further information.
