= Reserved keywords

[abstract]
--
Reserved keywords in Cypher.
These are words that have a special meaning in Cypher.
--

We provide here a listing of reserved words, grouped by the categories from which they are drawn, all of which have a special meaning in Cypher.
In addition to this, we list a number of words that are reserved for future use.

These reserved words are not permitted to be used as identifiers in the following contexts:

* Variables
* Function names
* Parameters

If any reserved keyword is escaped -- i.e. is encapsulated by backticks ```, such as `++`AND`++` -- it would become a valid identifier in the above contexts.
