Reserved keywords are words that have a special meaning in Cypher.
The listing of the reserved keywords are grouped by the categories from which they are drawn.
In addition to this, there are a number of keywords that are reserved for future use.

The reserved keywords are not permitted to be used as identifiers in the following contexts:

* Variables

If any reserved keyword is escaped -- i.e. is encapsulated by backticks ```, such as `++`AND`++` -- it would become a valid identifier in the above contexts.
