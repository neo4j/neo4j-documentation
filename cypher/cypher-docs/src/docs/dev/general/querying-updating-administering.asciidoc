This section describes using Cypher for both querying and updating your graph, as well as administering graphs and databases.
--

In the <<cypher-introduction, introduction>> we described the common case of using Cypher to perform read-only queries of the graph.
However, it is also possible to use Cypher to perform updates to the graph, import data into the graph, and perform administrative actions on graphs, databases and the entire DBMS.

All these various options are described in more detail in later sections, but it is worth summarizing a few key points first.

[[cypher-admin-queries]]
== The structure of administrative queries

Cypher administrative queries cannot be combined with normal reading and writing queries.
Each administrative query will perform either an update action to the `system` or a read of status information from the `system`.
Some administrative commands make changes to a specific database, and will therefore be possible to run only when connected to the database of interest.
Others make changes to the state of the entire DBMS and can only be run against the special `system` database.
All administrative queries are described in more detail in the section on <<administration, Administration>>.

[[cypher-updating-queries]]
== The structure of update queries


If you read from the graph and then update the graph, your query implicitly has two parts -- the reading is the first part, and the writing is the second part.

[NOTE]
A Cypher query part can either read and match on the graph, or make updates on it, not both simultaneously.


If your query only performs reads, Cypher will not actually match the pattern until you ask for the results.
In an updating query, the semantics are that _all_ the reading will be done before any writing is performed.

The only pattern where the query parts are implicit is when you first read and then write -- any other order and you have to be explicit about your query parts.
The parts are separated using the `WITH` statement.
`WITH` is like an event horizon -- it's a barrier between a plan and the finished execution of that plan.

When you want to filter using aggregated data, you have to chain together two reading query parts -- the first one does the aggregating, and the second filters on the results coming from the first one.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n {name: 'John'})-[:FRIEND]-(friend)
WITH n, count(friend) AS friendsCount
WHERE friendsCount > 3
RETURN n, friendsCount
----

Using `WITH`, you specify how you want the aggregation to happen, and that the aggregation has to be finished before Cypher can start filtering.

Here's an example of updating the graph, writing the aggregated data to the graph:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n {name: 'John'})-[:FRIEND]-(friend)
WITH n, count(friend) AS friendsCount
SET n.friendsCount = friendsCount
RETURN n.friendsCount
----

You can chain together as many query parts as the available memory permits.


[[cypher-returning-data]]
== Returning data

Any query can return data.
If a query only reads, it has to return data.
If a read-query doesn't return any data, it serves no purpose, and is therefore not a valid Cypher query.
Queries that update the graph don't have to return anything, but they can.

After all the parts of the query comes one final `RETURN` clause.
`RETURN` is not part of any query part -- it is a period symbol at the end of a query.
The `RETURN` clause has three sub-clauses that come with it: `SKIP`/`LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`.

If you return nodes or relationships from a query that has just deleted them -- beware, you are holding a pointer that is no longer valid.
