= Execution plans

[abstract]
--
This section describes operators used as part of an execution plan to execute a query in the Cypher query language.
--

Neo4j breaks down the work of executing a query into small pieces called operators.
Each operator is responsible for a small part of the overall query.
The operators are connected together in a pattern called a execution plan.

Each operator is annotated with statistics.

`Rows`::
The number of rows that the operator produced. Only available if the query was profiled.
`EstimatedRows`::
If Neo4j used the cost-based compiler you will see the estimated number of rows that will be produced by the operator.
The compiler uses this estimate to choose a suitable execution plan.
`DbHits`::
Each operator will ask the Neo4j storage engine to do work such as retrieving or updating data.
A _database hit_ is an abstract unit of this storage engine work.

See <<how-do-i-profile-a-query>> for how to view the execution plan for your query.

For a deeper understanding of how each operator works, see the relevant section.
Please remember that the statistics of the actual database where the queries run on will decide the plan used.
There is no guarantee that a specific query will always be solved with the same plan.

// The conditional leveloffsets below are "wrong" for the neo4j/neo4j
// Asciidoc+DB45 docs build, but AsciiDoc is limited to a certain depth so it
// is not possible to set them correctly. The downstream docs build is happy
// with these values.

Leaf operators, in general, locate the starting nodes and relationships required in order to execute the query.

Update operators are used in queries that update the graph.
