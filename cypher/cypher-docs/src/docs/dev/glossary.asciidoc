|Name           | Type | Description
| <<cypher-version, CYPHER $version query>>  | Version | This will force `'query'` to use Neo4j Cypher `$version`. The default is `3.3`.
| <<cypher-planner, CYPHER planner=rule query>> | Planner | This will force `'query'` to use the rule planner. As the rule planner was removed in 3.2, doing this will cause `'query'` to fall back to using Cypher 3.1.
| <<cypher-planner, CYPHER planner=cost query>> | Planner | Neo4j {neo4j-version} uses the cost planner for all queries.
| <<cypher-runtime, CYPHER runtime=interpreted query>> | Runtime | This will force the query execution engine to use the interpreted runtime. This is the only option in Neo4j Community Edition.
| <<cypher-runtime, CYPHER runtime=slotted query>> | Runtime | This will cause the query execution engine to use the slotted runtime. This is only available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
| <<cypher-runtime, CYPHER runtime=compiled query>> | Runtime | This will cause the query execution engine to use the compiled runtime if it supports `'query'`. This is only available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
