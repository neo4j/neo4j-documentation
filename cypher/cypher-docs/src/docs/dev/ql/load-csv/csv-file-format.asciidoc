= CSV file format

The CSV file to use with `LOAD CSV` must have the following characteristics:

* the character encoding is UTF-8;
* the end line termination is system dependent, e.g., it is `\n` on unix or `\r\n` on windows;
* the default field terminator is `,`;
* the field terminator character can be change by using the option `FIELDTERMINATOR` available in the `LOAD CSV` command;
* quoted strings are allowed in the CSV file and the quotes are dropped when reading the data;
* the character for string quotation is double quote `"`;
* if `dbms.import.csv.legacy_quote_escaping` is set to the default value of `true`, `\` is used as an escape character;
* a double quote must be in a quoted string and escaped, either with the escape character or a second double quote.
