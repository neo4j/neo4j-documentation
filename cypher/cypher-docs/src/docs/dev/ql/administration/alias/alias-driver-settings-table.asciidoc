This is the list of the allowed driver settings for remote aliases.

[[remote-alias-driver-settings]]
.ssl_enforced
[width="100%", cols="1s, 4a"]
|===
| Description | SSL for remote alias drivers is configured through the target url scheme.
If `ssl_enforced` is set to true, a secure url scheme is enforced. This will be validated when the command is executed.
| Valid values | Boolean
| Default value | true
|===

.connection_timeout
[width="100%", cols="1s, 4a"]
|===
| Description | Socket connection timeout.
A timeout of zero is treated as an infinite timeout and will be bound by the timeout configured on the operating system level.
| Valid values | Duration
| Default value |
<<operations-manual#config_dbms.routing.driver.connection.connect_timeout, dbms.routing.driver.connection.connect_timeout>>
|===

.connection_max_lifetime
[width="100%", cols="1s, 4a"]
|===
| Description | Pooled connections older than this threshold will be closed and removed from the pool.
Setting this option to a low value will cause a high connection churn and might result in a performance hit.
It is recommended to set maximum lifetime to a slightly smaller value than the one configured in network equipment (load balancer, proxy, firewall, etc. can also limit maximum connection lifetime).

| Valid values | Duration.

Zero and negative values result in lifetime not being checked.
| Default value |
<<operations-manual#config_dbms.routing.driver.connection.max_lifetime, dbms.routing.driver.connection.max_lifetime>>
|===

.connection_pool_acquisition_timeout
[width="100%", cols="1s, 4a"]
|===
| Description | Maximum amount of time spent attempting to acquire a connection from the connection pool.
This timeout only kicks in when all existing connections are being used and no new connections can be created
because maximum connection pool size has been reached. Error is raised when connection canâ€™t be acquired within configured time.
| Valid values | Duration.

Negative values are allowed and result in unlimited acquisition timeout.
Value of 0 is allowed and results in no timeout and immediate failure when connection is unavailable.
| Default value |
<<operations-manual#config_dbms.routing.driver.connection.pool.acquisition_timeout, dbms.routing.driver.connection.pool.acquisition_timeout>>
|===

.connection_pool_max_size
[width="100%", cols="1s, 4a"]
|===
| Description | Maximum total number of connections to be managed by a connection pool.
The limit is enforced for a combination of a host and user.
| Valid values | Integer.

Negative values are allowed and result in unlimited pool. Value of 0 is not allowed.
| Default value |
<<operations-manual#config_dbms.routing.driver.connection.pool.max_size, dbms.routing.driver.connection.pool.max_size>>
|===

.logging_level
[width="100%", cols="1s, 4a"]
|===
| Description | Sets level for driver internal logging.
| Valid values |  org.neo4j.logging.Level.

One of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `NONE`.
| Default value |
<<operations-manual#config_dbms.routing.driver.logging.level, dbms.routing.driver.logging.level>>
