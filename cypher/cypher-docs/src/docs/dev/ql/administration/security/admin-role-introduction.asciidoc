The built-in role `admin` includes a number of privileges allowing users granted this role the ability to perform administrative tasks.
These include the rights to perform the following classes of tasks:

* Manage <<administration-security-administration-database-privileges, database security>> for controlling the rights to perform actions on specific databases:
** Manage access to a database and the right to start and stop a database
** Manage <<administration-indexes-search-performance, indexes>> and <<administration-constraints, constraints>>
** Allow the creation of labels, relationship types or property names
* Manage <<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges, DBMS security>> for controlling the rights to perform actions on the entire system:
** Manage <<administration-databases, multiple databases>>
** Manage <<administration-security-users-and-roles, users and roles>>
** Change configuration parameters
** Manage transactions
** Manage sub-graph privileges
** Manage procedure security

These rights are conferred using privileges that can be  managed using `GRANT`, `DENY` and `REVOKE` commands,
with the exception of the _DBMS Security_ privileges which are only available within the built-in `admin` role.
