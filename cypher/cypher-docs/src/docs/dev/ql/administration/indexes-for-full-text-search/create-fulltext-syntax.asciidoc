CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX [index_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName[\|...])
ON EACH "[" n.propertyName[, ...] "]"
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]
----
| Create a fulltext index on nodes.
.2+.^| Best practice is to give the index a name when it is created. This name is needed for both dropping and querying the index.
If the index is not explicitly named, it will get an auto-generated name.

The index name must be unique among all indexes and constraints.

Index provider and configuration can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.

The command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to throw an error if you attempt to create the same index twice.
With `IF NOT EXISTS`, no error is thrown and nothing happens should an index with the same name, schema or both already exist.
It may still throw an error should a constraint with the same name exist.
