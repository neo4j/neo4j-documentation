[[administration-constraints-list-constraint]]
== Listing constraints

Listing constraints can be done with `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`, which will produce a table with the following columns:

.List constraints output
[options="header", width="100%", cols="1a,4,^.^,^"]
|===
| Column
| Description
| Default output
| Full output

| `id`
| The id of the constraint.
| `+`
| `+`

| `name`
| Name of the constraint (explicitly set by the user or automatically assigned).
| `+`
| `+`

| `type`
| The ConstraintType of this constraint (`UNIQUENESS`, `NODE_PROPERTY_EXISTENCE`, `NODE_KEY`, or `RELATIONSHIP_PROPERTY_EXISTENCE`).
| `+`
| `+`

| `entityType`
| Type of entities this constraint represents (nodes or relationship).
| `+`
| `+`

| `labelsOrTypes`
| The labels or relationship types of this constraint.
| `+`
| `+`

| `properties`
| The properties of this constraint.
| `+`
| `+`

| `ownedIndexId`
| The id of the index associated to the constraint, or `null` if no index is associated with the constraint.
| `+`
| `+`

| `options`
| The options passed to `CREATE` command, for the index associated to the constraint, or `null` if no index is associated with the constraint.
|
| `+`

| `createStatement`
| Statement used to create the constraint.
|
| `+`
|===

Listing constraints also allows for `WHERE` and `YIELD` clauses to filter the returned rows and columns.

[NOTE]
The deprecated built-in procedures for listing constraints, such as `db.constraints`, work as before and are not affected by the <<administration-security-administration-database-constraints, `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` privilege>>.
