[[administration-constraints-syntax-create]]
== Syntax for creating constraints

Best practice when creating a constraint is to give the constraint a name.
This name must be unique among both indexes and constraints.
If a name is not explicitly given, a unique name will be auto-generated.

The create constraint command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to throw an error if you attempt to create the same constraint twice.
With the `IF NOT EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should a constraint with the same name or same schema and constraint type already exist.
It may still throw an error should a conflicting index or constraint exist.

For constraints that are backed by an index, the index provider and configuration for the backing index can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.

[discrete]
=== Create a unique node property constraint

This command creates a uniqueness constraint on nodes with the specified label and property.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
ON (n:LabelName)
ASSERT n.propertyName IS UNIQUE
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]
----

[discrete]
=== [enterprise-edition]#Create a node property existence constraint#

This command creates a property existence constraint on nodes with the specified label and property.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
ON (n:LabelName)
ASSERT n.propertyName IS NOT NULL
----

[discrete]
=== [enterprise-edition]#Create a relationship property existence constraint#

This command creates a property existence constraint on relationships with the specified relationship type and property.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
ON ()-"["R:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE"]"-()
ASSERT R.propertyName IS NOT NULL
----

[discrete]
=== [enterprise-edition]#Create a node key constraint#

This command creates a node key constraint on nodes with the specified label and properties.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
ON (n:LabelName)
ASSERT (n.propertyName_1,
n.propertyName_2,
…
n.propertyName_n)
IS NODE KEY
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]

[[administration-constraints-syntax-drop]]
== Syntax for dropping constraints

[discrete]
=== Drop a constraint

The preferred way of dropping a constraint is by the name of the constraint.

This drop command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to throw an error if you attempt to drop the same constraint twice.
With the `IF EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should the constraint not exist.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name [IF EXISTS]
----

[discrete]
=== [deprecated]#Drop a unique constraint without specifying a name#

An old way of dropping a uniqueness constraint was to drop the constraint by specifying the schema of the constraint.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT
ON (n:LabelName)
ASSERT n.propertyName IS UNIQUE
----

[discrete]
=== [deprecated]#Drop a node property existence constraint without specifying a name#

An old way of dropping a node property existence constraint was to drop the constraint by specifying the schema of the constraint.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT
ON (n:LabelName)
ASSERT EXISTS (n.propertyName)
----

[discrete]
=== [deprecated]#Drop a relationship property existence constraint without specifying a name#

An old way of dropping a relationship property existence constraint was to drop the constraint by specifying the schema of the constraint.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT
ON ()-"["R:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE"]"-()
ASSERT EXISTS (R.propertyName)
----

[discrete]
=== [deprecated]#Drop a node key constraint without specifying a name#

An old way of dropping a node key constraint was to drop the constraint by specifying the schema of the constraint.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT
ON (n:LabelName)
ASSERT (n.propertyName_1,
n.propertyName_2,
…
n.propertyName_n)
IS NODE KEY
----


[[administration-constraints-syntax-list]]
== Syntax for listing constraints

List constraints in the database, either all or filtered on constraint type.

The simple version of the command allows for a where clause and will give back the default set of output columns:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW [ALL|UNIQUE|NODE [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|REL[ATIONSHIP] [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|[PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|NODE KEY] CONSTRAINT[S]
    [WHERE expression]
----

To get the full set of output columns, a yield clause is needed:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW [ALL|UNIQUE|NODE [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|REL[ATIONSHIP] [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|[PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|NODE KEY] CONSTRAINT[S]
    YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]
    [WHERE expression]
    [RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

The returned columns from the show command is:

[NOTE]
The deprecated built-in procedures for listing constraints, such as `db.constraints`, work as before and are not affected by the <<administration-security-administration-database-constraints, `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` privilege>>.
