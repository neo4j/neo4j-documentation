[[administration-constraints-syntax-create]]
== Syntax for creating constraints

Best practice when creating a constraint is to give the constraint a name.
This name must be unique among both indexes and constraints.
If a name is not explicitly given, a unique name will be auto-generated.

The create constraint command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to throw an error if you attempt to create the same constraint twice.
With the `IF NOT EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should a constraint with the same name or same schema and constraint type already exist.
It may still throw an error if conflicting data, indexes, or constraints exist.
Examples of this are nodes with missing properties, indexes with the same name, or constraints with same schema but a different constraint type.

For constraints that are backed by an index, the index provider for the backing index can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.
Only one valid value exists for the index provider, `range-1.0`, which is the default value.
There is no supported index configuration for range indexes.

Creating a constraint requires <<access-control-database-administration-constraints, the `CREATE CONSTRAINT` privilege>>.

[[administration-constraints-syntax-create-unique]]
[discrete]
=== Create a unique node property constraint

This command creates a uniqueness constraint on nodes with the specified label and properties.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
REQUIRE n.propertyName IS UNIQUE
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
REQUIRE (n.propertyName_1, …, n.propertyName_n) IS UNIQUE
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]
----

Index provider can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.

[[administration-constraints-syntax-create-node-exists]]
[discrete]
=== [enterprise-edition]#Create a node property existence constraint#

This command creates a property existence constraint on nodes with the specified label and property.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
REQUIRE n.propertyName IS NOT NULL
[OPTIONS "{" "}"]
----

There are no supported `OPTIONS` values for existence constraints, but an empty options map is allowed for consistency.

[[administration-constraints-syntax-create-rel-exists]]
[discrete]
=== [enterprise-edition]#Create a relationship property existence constraint#

This command creates a property existence constraint on relationships with the specified relationship type and property.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR ()-"["r:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE"]"-()
REQUIRE r.propertyName IS NOT NULL
[OPTIONS "{" "}"]
----

There are no supported `OPTIONS` values for existence constraints, but an empty options map is allowed for consistency.

[[administration-constraints-syntax-create-node-key]]
[discrete]
=== [enterprise-edition]#Create a node key constraint#

This command creates a node key constraint on nodes with the specified label and properties.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
REQUIRE n.propertyName IS NODE KEY
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]
----

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT [constraint_name] [IF NOT EXISTS]
FOR (n:LabelName)
REQUIRE (n.propertyName_1, …, n.propertyName_n) IS NODE KEY
[OPTIONS "{" option: value[, ...] "}"]
----

Index provider can be specified using the `OPTIONS` clause.

[[administration-constraints-syntax-drop]]
== Syntax for dropping constraints

Dropping a constraint is done by the name of the constraint.

This drop command is optionally idempotent, with the default behavior to throw an error if you attempt to drop the same constraint twice.
With the `IF EXISTS` flag, no error is thrown and nothing happens should the constraint not exist.

Dropping a constraint requires the <<access-control-database-administration-constraints, `DROP CONSTRAINT`>>  privilege.

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name [IF EXISTS]
----


[[administration-constraints-syntax-list]]
== Syntax for listing constraints

List constraints in the database, either all or filtered on constraint type.
This requires  the<<access-control-database-administration-constraints, `SHOW CONSTRAINT` >> privilege.

The simple version of the command allows for a `WHERE` clause and will give back the default set of output columns:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW [ALL|UNIQUE|NODE [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|REL[ATIONSHIP] [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|[PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|NODE KEY] CONSTRAINT[S]
    [WHERE expression]
----

To get the full set of output columns, a yield clause is needed:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
SHOW [ALL|UNIQUE|NODE [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|REL[ATIONSHIP] [PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|[PROPERTY] EXIST[ENCE]|NODE KEY] CONSTRAINT[S]
    YIELD { * | field[, ...] } [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]
    [WHERE expression]
    [RETURN field[, ...] [ORDER BY field[, ...]] [SKIP n] [LIMIT n]]
----

The returned columns from the show command is:

[NOTE]
The deprecated built-in procedures for listing constraints, such as `db.constraints`, work as before and are not affected by the <<access-control-database-administration-constraints, `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` privilege>>.
