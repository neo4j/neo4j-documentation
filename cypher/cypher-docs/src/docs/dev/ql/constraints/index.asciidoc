= Constraints

[abstract]
Neo4j helps enforce data integrity with the use of constraints.
Constraints can be applied to either nodes or relationships.
Unique node property constraints can be created, along with node and relationship property existence constraints, and Node Keys, which guarantee both existence and uniqueness.

[[query-constraint-introduction]]
== Introduction

Unique property constraints ensure that property values are unique for all nodes with a specific label.
Unique constraints do not mean that all nodes have to have a unique value for the properties -- nodes without the property are not subject to this rule.

Property existence constraints ensure that a property exists for all nodes with a specific label or for all relationships with a specific type.
All queries that try to create new nodes or relationships without the property, or queries that try to remove the mandatory property will now fail.

Node Keys ensure that, for a given label and set of properties:

[lowerroman]
. All the properties exist on all the nodes with that label.
. The combination of the property values is unique.

Queries attempting to do any of the following will fail:

* Create new nodes without all the properties or where the combination of property values is not unique.
* Remove one of the mandatory properties.
* Update the properties so that the combination of property values is no longer unique.

[NOTE]
Property existence constraints and Node Keys are only available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
Note that databases with property existence constraints and/or Node Keys cannot be opened using Neo4j Community Edition.

A given label can have multiple constraints, and unique and property existence constraints can be combined on the same property.

Adding constraints is an atomic operation that can take a while -- all existing data has to be scanned before Neo4j can turn the constraint 'on'.

Creating a constraint has the following implications on indexes:

* Adding a unique property constraint on a property will also add a <<schema-index-create-a-single-property-index, single-property index>> on that property, so such an index cannot be added separately.
* Adding a Node Key for a set of properties will also add a <<create-a-composite-index, composite index>> on those properties, so such an index cannot be added separately.
* Cypher will use these indexes for lookups just like other indexes; see the <<query-schema-index,Indexes>> section for more details on the rules governing their behavior.
* If a unique property constraint is dropped and the single-property index on the property is still required, the index will need to be created explicitly.
* If a Node Key is dropped and the composite-property index on the properties is still required, the index will need to be created explicitly.
