== Introduction

For deleting nodes and relationships, see <<query-delete>>.

[NOTE]
Removing labels from a node is an idempotent operation:
If you try to remove a label from a node that does not have that label on it, nothing happens.
The query statistics will tell you if something needed to be done or not.
