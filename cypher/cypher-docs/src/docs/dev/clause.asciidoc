[[header-reading-clauses]]
**Reading clauses**

These comprise clauses that read data from the database.

The flow of data within a Cypher query is an unordered sequence of maps with key-value pairs -- a set of possible bindings between the variables in the query and values derived from the database.
This set is refined and augmented by subsequent parts of the query.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

m|<<query-match, MATCH>>
|Specify the patterns to search for in the database.

m|<<query-optional-match, OPTIONAL MATCH>>
|Specify the patterns to search for in the database while using `nulls` for missing parts of the pattern.

|===


[[header-projecting-clauses]]
**Projecting clauses**

These comprise clauses that define which expressions to return in the result set.
The returned expressions may all be aliased using `AS`.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

//RETURN ... [AS]
m|<<query-return, RETURN +++...+++ [AS]>>
|Defines what to include in the query result set.

//WITH ... [AS]
m|<<query-with, WITH +++...+++ [AS]>>
|Allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.

//UNWIND ... [AS]
m|<<query-unwind, UNWIND +++...+++ [AS]>>
|Expands a list into a sequence of rows.

|===


[[header-reading-sub-clauses]]
**Reading sub-clauses**

These comprise sub-clauses that must operate as part of reading clauses.

[options="header"]
|===
|Sub-clause | Description

m|<<query-where, WHERE>>
|Adds constraints to the patterns in a `MATCH` or `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause or filters the results of a `WITH` clause.

//WHERE EXISTS { ... }
m|<<existential-subqueries, WHERE EXISTS +++{ ... }+++>>
|An existential sub-query used to filter the results of a `MATCH`, `OPTIONAL MATCH` or `WITH` clause.

//ORDER BY [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]
m|<<query-order, ORDER BY &#91;ASC&#91;ENDING&#93; &#124; DESC&#91;ENDING&#93;&#93;>>
|A sub-clause following `RETURN` or `WITH`, specifying that the output should be sorted in either ascending (the default) or descending order.

m|<<query-skip, SKIP>>
|Defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.

m|<<query-limit, LIMIT>>
|Constrains the number of rows in the output.

|===


[[header-reading-hints]]
**Reading hints**

These comprise clauses used to specify planner hints when tuning a query.
More details regarding the usage of these -- and query tuning in general -- can be found in <<query-using>>.

[options="header"]
|===
|Hint |Description

m|<<query-using-index-hint, USING INDEX>>
|Index hints are used to specify which index, if any, the planner should use as a starting point.

m|<<query-using-index-hint, USING INDEX SEEK>>
|Index seek hint instructs the planner to use an index seek for this clause.

m|<<query-using-scan-hint, USING SCAN>>
|Scan hints are used to force the planner to do a label scan (followed by a filtering operation) instead of using an index.

m|<<query-using-join-hint, USING JOIN>>
|Join hints are used to enforce a join operation at specified points.

|===


[[header-writing-clauses]]
**Writing clauses**

These comprise clauses that write the data to the database.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

m|<<query-create, CREATE>>
|Create nodes and relationships.

m|<<query-delete, DELETE>>
a|
Delete nodes, relationships or paths.
Any node to be deleted must also have all associated relationships explicitly deleted.

m|<<query-delete, DETACH DELETE>>
a|
Delete a node or set of nodes.
All associated relationships will automatically be deleted.

m|<<query-set, SET>>
|Update labels on nodes and properties on nodes and relationships.

m|<<query-remove, REMOVE>>
|Remove properties and labels from nodes and relationships.

m|<<query-foreach, FOREACH>>
|Update data within a list, whether components of a path, or the result of aggregation.

|===


[[header-reading-writing-clauses]]
**Reading/Writing clauses**

These comprise clauses that both read data from and write data to the database.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

|Ensures that a pattern exists in the graph. Either the pattern already exists, or it needs to be created.

m|--- <<query-merge-on-create-on-match, ON CREATE>>
|Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, this write sub-clause specifies the actions to take if the pattern needs to be created.

m|--- <<query-merge-on-create-on-match, ON MATCH>>
|Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, this write sub-clause specifies the actions to take if the pattern already exists.

//CALL ... [YIELD ... ]
m|<<query-call, CALL +++...+++ &#91;YIELD +++...+++ &#93;>>
|Invokes a procedure deployed in the database and return any results.

|===


[[header-set-operations-clauses]]

Duplicates are retained.

|===

[[header-subquery-clauses]]
**Subquery clauses**

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause |Description

//CALL { ... }
m|<<query-call-subquery, CALL +++{ ... }+++>>

m|<<subquery-call-in-transactions, CALL +++{ ... }+++ IN TRANSACTIONS>>
|Evaluates a subquery in separate transactions. 
Typically used when modifying or importing large amounts of data.

|===

[[header-multiple-graphs-clauses]]

m|<<query-load-csv, LOAD CSV>>
|Use when importing data from CSV files.

|Clause |Description

m|<<query-listing-functions, SHOW FUNCTIONS>>
