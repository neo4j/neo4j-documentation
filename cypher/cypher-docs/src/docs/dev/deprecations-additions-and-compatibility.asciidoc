Cypher is a language that is constantly evolving.
New features get added to the language continuously, and occasionally, some features become deprecated and are subsequently removed.

== Removals, deprecations, additions and extensions

The following tables lists all the features which have been removed, deprecated, added or extended in Cypher.
Replacement syntax for deprecated and removed features are also indicated.

=== Version 3.2
[options="header"]
|===
| Feature          | Type | Change | Details

| <<user-defined-aggregation-functions, User-defined aggregation functions>> | Functionality | Added |
| <<query-schema-index-introduction, Composite indexes>> | Index | Added |
| <<query-constraint-node-key, Node Key>> | Index | Added | Neo4j Enterprise Edition only
| `CYPHER runtime=compiled` (Compiled runtime) | Functionality | Added | Neo4j Enterprise Edition only
| <<functions-reverse-list,reverse()>> | Function  | Extended | Now also allows a list as input
| <<functions-max, max()>>, <<functions-min, min()>> | Function  | Extended | Now also supports aggregation over a set containing both strings and numbers
|===

=== Version 3.3
[options="header"]
|===
| Feature          | Type | Change | Details
| `START`     | Clause | Removed | Replaced by the built-in procedures `db.nodeManualIndexSeek`, `db.nodeManualIndexSearch`, `db.relationshipManualIndexSeek`, and `db.relationshipManualIndexSearch`
| <<functions-max, max()>>, <<functions-min, min()>> | Function  | Extended | Now also supports aggregation over a set containing lists of strings and numbers
|===


[[cypher-compatibility]]
== Compatibility

Older versions of the language can still be accessed if required.
There are two ways to select which version to use in queries.

. Setting a version for all queries:
You can configure your database with the configuration parameter `cypher.default_language_version`, and enter which version you'd like to use (see <<cypher-versions>>).
Every Cypher query will use this version, provided the query hasn't explicitly been configured as described in the next item below.

. Setting a version on a query-by-query basis:
The other method is to set the version for a particular query.
Prepending a query with `CYPHER 2.3` will execute the query with the version of Cypher included in Neo4j 2.3.

Below is an example using the `START` clause to access a legacy index:

[source, cypher]
----
CYPHER 2.3
START n=node:nodes(name = "A")
RETURN n
----


[[cypher-versions]]
== Supported language versions

Neo4j 3.3 supports the following versions of the Cypher language:

* Neo4j Cypher 3.3
* Neo4j Cypher 3.2
* Neo4j Cypher 3.1
* Neo4j Cypher 2.3

[TIP]
Each release of Neo4j supports a limited number of old Cypher Language Versions.
When you upgrade to a new release of Neo4j, please make sure that it supports the Cypher language version you need.
If not, you may need to modify your queries to work with a newer Cypher language version.
