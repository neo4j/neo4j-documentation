[[cypher-compatibility]]
== Compatibility

NOTE: The ability of Neo4j to support multiple older versions of the Cypher language has been changing.
In versions of Neo4j before 3.5 the backwards compatibility layer included the Cypher language parser, planner and runtime.
All supported versions of Cypher would run on the same Neo4j kernel.
In Neo4j 3.4, however, this was changed such that the compatibility layer no longer included the runtime.
This meant that running, for example, a `CYPHER 3.1` query inside Neo4j 3.5 would plan the query using the 3.1 planner, and run it using the 3.5 runtime and kernel.
In Neo4j 4.0 this was changed again, such that the compatibility layer includes only the parser.
For example, running a `CYPHER 3.5` query inside Neo4j will parse older language features, but plan using the {neo4j-version} planner, and run using the {neo4j-version} runtime and kernel.
The primary reason for this change has been optimizations in the Cypher runtime to allow Cypher query to perform better.

Older versions of the language can still be accessed if required.
There are two ways to select which version to use in queries.

. Setting a version for all queries:
You can configure your database with the configuration parameter `cypher.default_language_version`, and enter which version you'd like to use (see <<cypher-versions>>).
Every Cypher query will use this version, provided the query hasn't explicitly been configured as described in the next item below.

. Setting a version on a query by query basis:
The other method is to set the version for a particular query.
Prepending a query with `CYPHER 3.5` will execute the query with the version of Cypher included in Neo4j 3.5.

Below is an example using the older parameter syntax `+{param}+`:

[source, cypher]
----
CYPHER 3.5
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE n.age > {agelimit}
RETURN n.name, n.age
----

Without the `CYPHER 3.5` prefix this query would fail with a syntax error. With `CYPHER 3.5` however, it will only generate a warning and still work.

WARNING: In Neo4j {neo4j-version} some older language features are understood by the Cypher parser even if they are no longer supported by the Neo4j kernel.
These features will result in runtime errors. See the table at <<cypher-deprecations-additions-removals-4.0, Cypher Version 4.0>> for the list of affected features.

== Supported language versions

Neo4j {neo4j-version} supports the following versions of the Cypher language:

* Neo4j Cypher 3.5
* Neo4j Cypher 4.2
* Neo4j Cypher 4.3

[TIP]
Each release of Neo4j supports a limited number of old Cypher Language Versions.
When you upgrade to a new release of Neo4j, please make sure that it supports the Cypher language version you need.
If not, you may need to modify your queries to work with a newer Cypher language version.
