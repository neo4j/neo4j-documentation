Cypher is a language that is constantly evolving.
New features get added to the language continuously, and occasionally, some features become deprecated and are subsequently removed.

[[cypher-deprecations-additions-removals]]
== Removals, deprecations, additions and extensions

The following tables lists all the features which have been removed, deprecated, added or extended in Cypher.
Replacement syntax for deprecated and removed features are also indicated.


[[cypher-deprecations-additions-removals-3.0]]
=== Version 3.0
[options="header"]
|===

| <<functions-point,point() - WGS 84 2D>> | Function | Added |
| <<functions-distance,distance()>> | Function | Added |
| <<procedures, User-defined procedures>> | Functionality | Added |
|  <<functions-tostring, toString()>>   | Function  | Extended | Now also allows Boolean values as input
|===


[[cypher-deprecations-additions-removals-3.1]]

[options="header"]
|===
| Feature          | Type | Change | Details
| `rels()`   | Function  | Deprecated | Replaced by <<functions-relationships, relationships()>>
| `toInt()`   | Function  | Deprecated | Replaced by <<functions-tointeger, toInteger()>>
| `lower()`   | Function  | Deprecated | Replaced by <<functions-tolower, toLower()>>
| `upper()`   | Function  | Deprecated | Replaced by <<functions-toupper, toUpper()>>

| <<query-call, CALL\...YIELD\...WHERE>>   | Clause  | Extended  | Records returned by `YIELD` may be filtered further using `WHERE`
|===


[[cypher-deprecations-additions-removals-3.2]]
=== Version 3.2
[options="header"]
|===
| Feature          | Type | Change | Details
| `CYPHER planner=rule` (Rule planner)    | Functionality | Removed | All queries now use the cost planner. Any query prepended thus will fall back to using Cypher 3.1.
| `CREATE UNIQUE`     | Clause | Removed | Running such queries will fall back to using Cypher 3.1 (and use the rule planner)
| `START`     | Clause | Removed | Running such queries will fall back to using Cypher 3.1 (and use the rule planner)
| `MATCH (n)-[rs*]-() RETURN rs`     | Syntax | Deprecated | Replaced by `MATCH p=(n)-[*]-() RETURN relationships(p) AS rs`
| `MATCH (n)-[:A\|:B\|:C {foo: 'bar'}]-() RETURN n`     | Syntax | Deprecated | Replaced by `MATCH (n)-[:A\|B\|C {foo: 'bar'}]-() RETURN n`
| `MATCH (n)-[x:A\|:B\|:C]-() RETURN n`     | Syntax | Deprecated | Replaced by `MATCH (n)-[x:A\|B\|C]-() RETURN n`
| `MATCH (n)-[x:A\|:B\|:C*]-() RETURN n`     | Syntax | Deprecated | Replaced by `MATCH (n)-[x:A\|B\|C*]-() RETURN n`
| <<user-defined-aggregation-functions, User-defined aggregation functions>> | Functionality | Added |
| <<query-schema-index-introduction, Composite indexes>> | Index | Added |
| <<query-constraint-node-key, Node Key>> | Index | Added | Neo4j Enterprise Edition only
| `CYPHER runtime=compiled` (Compiled runtime) | Functionality | Added | Neo4j Enterprise Edition only
| <<functions-reverse-list,reverse()>> | Function  | Extended | Now also allows a list as input
| <<functions-max, max()>>, <<functions-min, min()>> | Function  | Extended | Now also supports aggregation over a set containing both strings and numbers
|===


[[cypher-deprecations-additions-removals-3.3]]
=== Version 3.3
[options="header"]
|===
| Feature          | Type | Change | Details
| `START`          | Clause | Removed | As in Cypher 3.2, any queries using the `START` clause will revert back to Cypher 3.1 `planner=rule`.
However, there are <<explicit-indexes-procedures, built-in procedures>> for accessing explicit indexes that will enable users to use the current version of Cypher and the cost planner together with these indexes.
An example of this is `CALL db.index.explicit.searchNodes('my_index','email:me*')`.
| `CYPHER runtime=slotted` (Faster interpreted runtime) | Functionality | Added | Neo4j Enterprise Edition only
| <<functions-max, max()>>, <<functions-min, min()>> | Function  | Extended | Now also supports aggregation over sets containing lists of strings and/or numbers, as well as over sets containing strings, numbers, and lists of strings and/or numbers
|===

[[cypher-deprecations-additions-removals-3.4]]
=== Version 3.4
[options="header"]
|===
| Feature          | Type | Change | Details
| Spatial point types | Functionality | Amendment | A point -- irrespective of which coordinate reference system is used -- can be stored as a property and is able to be backed by an index. Prior to this, a point was a virtual property only.
| <<functions-point-cartesian-3d,point() - Cartesian 3D>> | Function | Added |
| <<functions-point-wgs84-3d,point() - WGS 84 3D>> | Function | Added |
|===

[[cypher-compatibility]]
== Compatibility

Older versions of the language can still be accessed if required.
There are two ways to select which version to use in queries.

. Setting a version for all queries:
You can configure your database with the configuration parameter `cypher.default_language_version`, and enter which version you'd like to use (see <<cypher-versions>>).
Every Cypher query will use this version, provided the query hasn't explicitly been configured as described in the next item below.

. Setting a version on a query by query basis:
The other method is to set the version for a particular query.
Prepending a query with `CYPHER 2.3` will execute the query with the version of Cypher included in Neo4j 2.3.

Below is an example using the `has()` function:

[source, cypher]
----
CYPHER 2.3
MATCH (n:Person)
WHERE has(n.age)
RETURN n.name, n.age
----


[[cypher-versions]]
== Supported language versions

Neo4j 3.4 supports the following versions of the Cypher language:

* Neo4j Cypher 3.4
* Neo4j Cypher 3.3
* Neo4j Cypher 3.2
* Neo4j Cypher 2.3

[TIP]
Each release of Neo4j supports a limited number of old Cypher Language Versions.
When you upgrade to a new release of Neo4j, please make sure that it supports the Cypher language version you need.
If not, you may need to modify your queries to work with a newer Cypher language version.
