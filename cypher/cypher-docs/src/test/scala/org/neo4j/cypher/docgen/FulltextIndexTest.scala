          |Full-text indexes are powered by the http://lucene.apache.org/[Apache Lucene] indexing and search library, and can be used to index nodes and relationships by string properties.
          |A full-text index allows you to write queries that match within the _contents_ of indexed string properties.
          |For instance, the btree indexes described in previous sections can only do exact matching or prefix matches on strings.
          |A full-text index will instead tokenize the indexed string values, so it can match _terms_ anywhere within the strings.
          |How the indexed strings are tokenized and broken into terms, is determined by what analyzer the full-text index is configured with.
          |For instance, the _swedish_ analyzer knows how to tokenize and stem Swedish words, and will avoid indexing Swedish stop words.
