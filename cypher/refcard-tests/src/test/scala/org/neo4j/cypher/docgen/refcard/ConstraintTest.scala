//

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person)
       ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE
###

Create a unique property constraint on the label `Person` and property `name`.
If any other node with that label is updated or created with a `name` that
already exists, the write operation will fail.
This constraint will create an accompanying index.

###assertion=drop-unique-property-constraint
//

DROP CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person)
     ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE
###

Drop the unique constraint and index on the label `Person` and property `name`.

###assertion=create-node-property-existence-constraint
//

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person)
       ASSERT exists(p.name)
###

(★) Create a node property existence constraint on the label `Person` and property `name`.
If a node with that label is created without a `name`, or if the `name` property is
removed from an existing node with the `Person` label, the write operation will fail.

###assertion=drop-node-property-existence-constraint
//

DROP CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person)
     ASSERT exists(p.name)
###

(★) Drop the node property existence constraint on the label `Person` and property `name`.

###assertion=create-relationship-property-existence-constraint
//

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON ()-[l:LIKED]-()
       ASSERT exists(l.when)
###

(★) Create a relationship property existence constraint on the type `LIKED` and property `when`.
If a relationship with that type is created without a `when`, or if the `when` property is
removed from an existing relationship with the `LIKED` type, the write operation will fail.

###assertion=drop-relationship-property-existence-constraint
//

DROP CONSTRAINT ON ()-[l:LIKED]-()
     ASSERT exists(l.when)
###

(★) Drop the relationship property existence constraint on the type `LIKED` and property `when`.

If a node with that label is created without both `firstname` and `surname`
or if the combination of the two is not unique,
or if the `firstname` and/or `surname` labels on an existing node with the `Person` label
is modified to violate these constraints, the write operation will fail.
