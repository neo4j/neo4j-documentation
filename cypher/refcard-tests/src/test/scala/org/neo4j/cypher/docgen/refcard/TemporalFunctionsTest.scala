###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

date("2018-04-05")
###
Returns a date parsed from a string.

###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

localtime("12:45:30.25")
###

Returns a time with no time zone.

###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

time("12:45:30.25+01:00")
###

Returns a time in a specified time zone.

###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

localdatetime("2018-04-05T12:34:00")
###

Returns a datetime with no time zone.

###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

datetime("2018-04-05T12:34:00[Europe/Berlin]")
###

Returns a datetime in the specified time zone.

###assertion=returns-one
RETURN

datetime({epochMillis: 3360000})
###
Transforms 3360000 as a UNIX Epoch time into a normal datetime.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=date
RETURN

date({year: {year}, month: {month}, day: {day}})
###

All of the temporal functions can also be called with a map of named components.
This example returns a date from `year`, `month` and `day` components.
Each function supports a different set of possible components.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=datetime
RETURN

datetime({date: {date}, time: {time}})
###

Temporal types can be created by combining other types. This example creates a `datetime` from a `date` and a `time`.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=dateselection
RETURN

date({date: {datetime}, day: 5})
###

Temporal types can be created by selecting from more complex types, as well as overriding individual components.
This example creates a `date` by selecting from a `datetime`, as well as overriding the `day` component.

###assertion=returns-one parameters=dateselection


WITH date("2018-04-05") AS d
RETURN d.year, d.month, d.day, d.week, d.dayOfWeek
###

Accessors allow extracting components of temporal types.
