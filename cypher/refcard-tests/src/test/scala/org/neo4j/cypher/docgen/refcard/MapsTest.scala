Literal maps are declared in curly braces much like property maps.
Lists are supported.

###assertion=returns-one
//

WITH {person: {name: 'Anne', age: 25}} AS p
RETURN p.person.name

###

Access the property of a nested map.

###assertion=returns-one-merge parameters=map
//

MERGE (p:Person {name: $map.name})
  ON CREATE SET p = $map

RETURN p
###

Maps can be passed in as parameters and used either as a map or by accessing keys.

###assertion=returns-one
//

MATCH (matchedNode:Person)
RETURN matchedNode

###

Nodes and relationships are returned as maps of their data.

###assertion=returns-one
WITH {name: 'Alice', age: 38, children: ['John', 'Max']} AS map
RETURN

map.name, map.age, map.children[0]

###

Map entries can be accessed by their keys.
Invalid keys result in an error.
